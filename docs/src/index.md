# CitableCorpus.jl

The CitableCorpus.jl package defines functions for working with two structures:  a `CitableNode` and a `CitableTextCorpus`.

A `CitableNode` associates a `CtsUrn` with a string value for the content of the passage.

A `CitableTextCorpus` is a wrapper around a vector of `CitableNode`s.
